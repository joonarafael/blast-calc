# BLAST CALC

The application is constantly running at [blastcalc.vercel.app](https://blastcalc.vercel.app/ "Blast Calc").

Check all the documentation, including the User Manual, [here](https://github.com/joonarafael/blast-calc/tree/main/documentation "Project Documentation Folder").

## General Description

This is the source code for a web application used for the creation of blasting circuit diagrams and the calculation of detonation delays. It will also produce other relevant data for the blasting planning process, e.g. histograms showing the spread of the detonations over time.

Users may also save their current plan and download it as a local file. Work on the same plan can be continued later by uploading the plan from file.

## Technical Details

Application built with TypeScript utilizing the React *framework :)*, running on a Node.js server. Application logic is almost completely executed on the client machine to minimize server load.
